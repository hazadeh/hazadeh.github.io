## Projects


[**AraNet**](https://github.com/UBC-NLP/aranet)

A Deep Learning Toolkit for Social Media explained in this [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.osact-1.3.pdf).
It models predict age, dialect, gender, emotion, irony, and sentiment. AraNet either delivers state-of-the-art performance on a number of these tasks and performs competitively on others. Checkout the repo [here](https://github.com/UBC-NLP/aranet).

**Preposition Sense Disambiguation**

A PSD system incorporated into [Faraazin](https://ut.ac.ir/en/news/5908/ut-faraazin-translates-english-and-persian-texts), an English-Persian machine translator. 
The system consists of two phases: phase one detects the english sense, and phase two maps it to the proper Persian translation.
The mapping is available [here](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/web/nlp/resources).

**Auto-Completion system for Mail Server**

Anonymizing and cleaning mailing dataset and building and smoothing n-gram language model based on that.
The model is used in auto-completion system for the university mailing system.

[**Socrates T.A.**](https://github.com/hazadeh/Socrates)

Design and implement a conceptual search system that teaches student how to do search on a conversational basis.

---
**Authorship Identification**

Building a classifier for authorship identification task on PAN shared task dataset. 

---
[**R2RML**](https://github.com/hazadeh/r2rml_processor)

Design and implement of an [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/) system for relational database with a specific connector for MSSQL database. The source code avaiable on [R2RML_Processor](https://github.com/hazadeh/r2rml_processor)
